After completing the assignment, please answer the questions in this text file and submit it to I-Learn.

1. Provide a link to your myDb.sql file at GitHub (the file that contains all the SQL commands needed to create your database).
    https://github.com/allen-brad/cs341-php/tree/master/db/W04

2. Describe something from your database that you think came together very nicely.
    While not an engineer, I work with data a lot at work so I'm familiar with relational databases.
    My project will be used in real life and I tried to design a database that will actually be used.

3. Describe something from your database that you think could be improved or extended in the future.
    In the members table the Members of Search and Rescue will be the users of the application.
    This means that the createdBy and lastUpdateBy IDs will be the primary key from the same table.
    I haven't figure out how to do a FK using the PK yet.


4. Briefly describe the "coolest" thing you learned while completing this assignment.
    Don't use quotes to define the table name or field names when creating tables. "Member" and Member are !=

5. Briefly describe two principles of good database design.
    Don't repeat data.
    Related data belongs in separate table.
    Use primary keys to identify a set of related data.

6. Please select the category you feel best describes your assignment:
        1 - Some attempt was made
        2 - Developing, but significantly deficient
        3 - Slightly deficient, but still mostly adequate
        4 - Meets requirements
    5 - Shows creativity and excels above and beyond requirements


7. Provide a brief justification (1-2 sentences) for selecting that category.
    My database follows good design and is more complex that is required including multiple FKs.
